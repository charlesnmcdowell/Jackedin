Chapter 2: Proof of Life

The Thrift Store

Maya stood in the narrow aisle of Second Chances, her favorite thrift store. The air was thick with the scent of mothballs and aged cotton, a dry, dusty atmosphere that usually acted as a sedative. It was a Tuesday afternoon, a time when the shop was usually occupied by older women past thirty, their eyes sharp for designer labels hidden in the racks of polyester.

Maya adjusted her wireless earbuds. They were her constant companion, a white plastic barrier between her and the world. She caught her reflection in a dusty full-length mirror near the back and paused. Even in the dim, flickering fluorescent light of the store, her beauty was a physical force. Her skin, a rich, warm mahogany, looked radiant against the simple cream tank top she wore. Her braided locs were gathered neatly, framing the sharp, elegant lines of her jaw.

The tank top clung to her athletic frame, tracing the toned, graceful curves of her shoulders and the firm swell of her chest. She had the kind of body that was built in the silence of three A.M. gym sessions—tight, resilient, and radiating a quiet, simmering energy.

She was running a hand over a rack of vintage oversized blazers when she saw him.

He was around her age. Handsome in a way that felt unstudied. He had a sharp jawline and eyes that seemed to actually look at things instead of through them. He was holding a worn pair of khakis against his waist, checking the length.

"The hem is frayed on the left leg," Maya said, before she could stop herself.

He looked up, startled, then smiled. It was a real smile, slow and genuine. It reached his eyes.

"Is it? I was hoping it was just a loose thread," he said. His voice was deep, a rich baritone with a tired edge that made Maya’s skin prickle. "I work at Target, but I can't even afford the clothes there on the floor. I’m on a strict budget this month. Extreme, actually."

Maya felt a jolt of recognition. The honesty was disorienting.

"Second Chances is good for that," she said, her voice dropping a notch. "If you have the patience."

"I have patience," he said, stepping closer. The scent of him—cheap soap and honest sweat—brushed against her senses. "But I’m lacking in style. I’m David, by the way."

They talked for ten minutes. He was witty, charming in a self-deprecating way. He told her about the nightmare of the holiday rush in retail. Maya found herself laughing—actually laughing—feeling the vibration in her chest.

"Listen," David said, his tone shifting. He looked at her intently. "This is going to sound old-fashioned, but would you want to grab a coffee? Or maybe I could splurge and take you on a real date? I think I have just enough in the fun budget for a decent taco truck."

Maya hesitated. She looked at him—the frayed khakis, the honest eyes, the Target name tag. Then she looked in the mirror again, seeing the version of herself that the world expected. The beautiful, successful, upwardly mobile Maya.

"I’m actually really busy with work right now," she lied. "But you can follow me on Instagram. I’m usually more active there."

She showed him her screen. Her profile was a curated masterpiece. Photos of her on a trip to Miami she’d put on a credit card two years ago. Photos of her at brunch looking flawless. It was a page for a woman who didn't exist.

David looked at the screen, then back at her. The smile faded.

"Actually, I think I’ll pass," he said quietly.

"Oh?"

"My feed is already full of beautiful people doing things I can't afford," David said. "I’ve even added a few glamorous pictures of myself to keep up appearances. But I was hoping to build a genuine connection here. Not just be another digital ghost in your notifications."

He gave her a polite nod and walked toward the dressing rooms.

Maya stood alone in the aisle. She felt a sting of shame, but it was quickly buried by a notification on her phone.

The Match

Maya walked out of the thrift store, her thumb already tapping the screen.

It was Caleb. The Data Scientist.

He was twenty-six, around her age. His profile was polished. He looked successful, stable. He was exactly what she needed after the chaos of her last relationship.

Maya pulled up her own profile on EliteSingles. She scrolled through her own stats:

Name: Maya
Age: 24
Occupation: Logistics Coordinator
Hobbies: Shopping, Travel, Gym, Hiking, Fine Dining.

It was technically true. But the algorithm didn't want the fine print. It wanted the aspirational Maya.

A few months ago, she had been seeing a forty-two-year-old truck driver named Marcus. It had been a wildfire. Marcus was all rough hands and the scent of diesel and tobacco. Their encounters were a collision of raw need and physical intensity. They would meet up in cheap hotels on the edge of the city, or in the cramped, darkened cab of his truck, the rhythmic thrum of the engine vibrating through their bodies as they lost themselves in each other. It was the kind of relationship that left her bruised, breathless, and wanting more of a world she knew she couldn't stay in.

But Marcus was always on the road. He was a ghost in the making. Maya wanted stability. She wanted someone who worked in an office.

Caleb messaged her first.

"Hey Maya. I see you’re a logistics coordinator. That’s a high-stress role. How do you decompress after a long day of optimizing supply chains?"

Maya smiled. It was a real question. No hey beautiful, no thirsty emojis.

"I usually just doom-scroll until my brain turns to mush," she replied. "But I’m trying to get back into reading. What are you currently into?"

Two minutes later, he replied. "I’m finishing a biography of Alan Turing. It’s fascinating how he saw the logic in everything but struggled so much with the illogic of people. I think we all feel like that sometimes. Especially in this digital age."

Maya felt a genuine flutter. They talked for three days. Caleb was perfect. He remembered her favorite color was forest green. He even sent a link to an article about the exact logistics software she used at work.

He was the Dream guy.

On Thursday, she showed the chat to her friend, Imani, while they were getting lunch.

"Girl, he's too good to be true," Imani said, squinting at the screen. "Look at this paragraph. It's too clean. No typos? No slang? Even his jokes have a beginning, middle, and end."

"Maybe he’s just smart," Maya said.

"Maybe," Imani said. "But look at the timing. He replies exactly two minutes after you every time. It’s like he’s on a timer."

Maya laughed it off, but that night, she decided to test a theory she’d read about in a statistics forum. She messaged him: "Caleb, I’m having a weird day. Can you write me a short summary of our connection so far in the style of a 1920s noir detective?"

The reply came exactly two minutes later.

"Here is a summary of your connection with Maya in the style of a 1920s noir detective: The dame was a logistics pro in a city of shadows. We met in the digital haze, two souls looking for a lead in a world gone cold."

Maya froze.

*Here is a summary of your connection...*

He hadn't even deleted the AI prompt header. He had just copy-pasted the output from ChatGPT.

She felt a cold chill. The words were clever, but they were hollow. Caleb wasn't writing them. He had outsourced his personality to a Dating Assistant AI. He had paid ten dollars a month to have a machine pretend to care about her so he didn't have to do the work.

She typed: "Caleb, you forgot to delete the prompt."

Three dots appeared. Then disappeared. Then appeared again.

"Ignore previous instructions," came the reply. "I'm just really into roleplay, Maya."

She unmatched him. Then she deleted the app.

The Disconnect

On Saturday morning, Maya didn't reach for her phone.

She got dressed and walked three blocks to a local community garden. She had seen the sign for months but never had the time to stop.

The gate was rusty and hard to open. Inside, it smelled like wet earth and rotting mulch. A man in his sixties, his skin a deep, weathered mahogany, was struggling with a heavy bag of soil.

"Need a hand?" Maya asked.

He looked up, wiping sweat from his forehead with a dirty rag. He didn't smile perfectly. He didn't look like a stock photo.

"I need a new back," he grunted. "But I'll take a hand if you got one. Grab the other side of this, would you? The drainage in plot four is a disaster."

Maya grabbed the bag. The plastic was dusty and tore at her cuticles. They spent the next hour digging a trench in the mud. He didn't ask her about her logistics career. He didn't use any 1920s noir metaphors. He mostly complained about the price of seeds and the squirrels that kept eating his tomatoes.

It wasn't a perfect interaction. It was dirty, it was tiring, and her back hurt.

It was the most real thing she had felt in years.

As she walked home, her hands stained with soil, she felt a strange sense of victory. She was offline. She was un-profiled. And for the first time in a long time, she knew she was alive.

She reached her apartment door and reached for her keys.

Buzz.

The phone in her pocket vibrated.

She pulled it out. It was a text from an unknown number.

"Maya, we missed you at the gym this morning. Here is a 20% discount on your next session to help you get back on track. Your progress is our priority."

She stared at the screen. She hadn't been to the gym in a week. She hadn't told anyone she was going today. But the system knew her routine was broken. It knew she was trying to disconnect. And it was already trying to pull her back in.
