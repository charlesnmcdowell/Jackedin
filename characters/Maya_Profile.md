## Appearance
Maya is a young Black woman with an athletic build. She wears her hair in thick, neatly styled braided locs that fall just past her shoulders. Her eyes are large and expressive, often reflecting a mixture of exhaustion and sharp intelligence. In her "working" life, she favors clean-cut blazers and wireless earbuds—her constant shield against the noise of the world. In the image provided, she is seen in a shopping environment, her focus entirely consumed by the blue light of her smartphone.

## The Two Mayas

### The Curated Maya (Social Media / Dating Profile)
*   **Hobbies:** Shopping (High-end), Travel (Luxury), Gym, Hiking, Fine Dining, Outdoor Activities.
*   **Vibe:** "Living my best life." Her feed is a collection of high-definition highlights: a weekend in Miami from two years ago, a photo of a $20 cocktail she nursed for an hour, and gym selfies in pristine matching sets.

### The Real Maya (Daily Reality)
*   **Hobbies:** Thrift Store hunting (out of necessity), "Hiking" (walking to the community garden to save on gas), "Fine Dining" (aesthetic coffee shops once a month as a reward for not crying over her student loan balance).
*   **Vibe:** "The Math isn't Mathing." She is a high-achiever drowning in a low-reward economy. She is lonely, analytically minded to a fault, and increasingly aware that her digital identity is a ghost she can no longer afford to haunt.
