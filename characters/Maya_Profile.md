# Character Profile: Maya Brooks

**Name:** Maya Brooks  
**Age:** 24  
**Education:** B.S. in Business & Statistics.  
**Job:** Junior Logistics Coordinator (Entry Level).  
**Location:** Atlanta metro area.

## Appearance
Maya is a young Black woman of striking, natural beauty that she often tries to downplay in the sterile environment of her corporate office. She has a luminous, warm mahogany complexion that seems to hold the light even in the dim glow of her apartment. Her face is defined by high, elegant cheekbones and a sharp, regal jawline that gives her an air of quiet authority.

She wears her hair in thick, intricately styled braided locs—a deep, obsidian black—that frame her face perfectly and fall with a heavy, rhythmic grace just past her shoulders. Her eyes are her most arresting feature: large, almond-shaped, and a deep liquid brown, fringed by thick lashes. They possess a depth that suggests she is always calculating, always seeing two steps ahead, even when she’s exhausted.

Maya possesses an athletic, lithe build—the result of disciplined, late-night gym sessions that serve as her only outlet for the mounting pressure of her life. She has a graceful, long-limbed way of moving that makes even a simple walk down a thrift store aisle look like a slow-motion sequence from a film. In her professional life, she masks this radiance behind sharp blazers and neutral tones, using her wireless earbuds as a high-tech shield against a world that she feels is constantly trying to extract something from her.

## The Two Mayas

### The Curated Maya (Social Media / Dating Profile)
*   **Hobbies:** Shopping (High-end), Travel (Luxury), Gym, Hiking, Fine Dining, Outdoor Activities.
*   **Vibe:** "Living my best life." Her feed is a collection of high-definition highlights: a weekend in Miami from two years ago, a photo of a $20 cocktail she nursed for an hour, and gym selfies in pristine matching sets that accentuate her curves and strength.

### The Real Maya (Daily Reality)
*   **Hobbies:** Thrift Store hunting (out of necessity), "Hiking" (walking to the community garden to save on gas), "Fine Dining" (aesthetic coffee shops once a month as a reward for not crying over her student loan balance).
*   **Vibe:** "The Math isn't Mathing." She is a high-achiever drowning in a low-reward economy. She is lonely, analytically minded to a fault, and increasingly aware that her digital identity is a ghost she can no longer afford to haunt.
