## Appearance
Marcus is a physical force. Tall, dark-skinned, with the kind of body that isn't built in a gym but carved out of decades of lifting heavy things. He keeps a clean-cut fade and a groomed beard that frames a handsome, weary face. He knows he looks good. He knows that when he puts on a tight shirt that accentuates his chest and arms, the conversation changes.

## The Vibe
Marcus is "The Last Bull." He isn't interested in the digital world, politics, or saving the next generation. He’s interested in survival and pleasure. He grew up sleeping on living room floors and dodging the prison-industrial complex. He learned early that violence is a trap and love is a transaction.

## The Vices: Women
Marcus is a master of the "casual encounter." He isn't looking for a wife. He’s looking for a night. He knows the game: women cheat, women lie, and women want what they can't have. He provides the physical experience—the "9-inch rod," the stamina, the raw masculinity—that they can't get from their soft, office-working husbands. He visits 3-4 women a day in his prime, dodging jealous boyfriends and drama with a cool detachment. He is selfish with his money and his heart, but generous with his body.

## The Maya Connection
Maya is just another stop on the route, but a favorite one. He doesn't care about her stats degree or her corporate ladder. He cares that she is young, beautiful, and responsive. He knows she wants a "successful" man to buy her a house, and he knows he isn't that man. He doesn't pretend to be. He offers her the back of his cab or a Motel 6 bed, and because of who he is—physically dominant, charming, and skilled—she says yes. He makes her orgasm, he makes her forget her spreadsheets, and then he sends her on her way. It’s simple. It’s honest.

## The Conflict: Aging vs. The Future
The clock is ticking. His back hurts. His knees pop. He knows he can't be a "workhorse" forever. He looks at his kids—grown now, soft, glued to their screens—and feels no connection to their struggle. They have it easy. His only concern is **Future Marcus**. He needs a retirement plan. He needs to figure out how to navigate this new world of AI trucks and automation not to save the industry, but to save himself.
