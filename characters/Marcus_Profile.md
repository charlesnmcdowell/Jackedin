## Appearance
Marcus is a traditionally attractive man who carries the physical weight of twenty years of labor with a rugged, disciplined grace. He is tall, light-skinned, with an athletic build maintained by constant work and frequent gym stops. He keeps himself sharp: a perfectly groomed beard and a clean-cut fade. He is the kind of man who looks like he belongs on the cover of a trade magazine, even when he’s covered in grease and road dust.

## The Vibe
Marcus is "The Physical Ghost." He exists in the spaces between cities, moving the weight of the world while the world sleeps. He is not tech-savvy; he trusts what he can touch, what he can fix with a wrench, and what he can carry in his pocket. He usually has twenty thousand dollars in hard cash on him at any given time—his literal "life insurance."

## The Struggles
*   **The Family Web:** He has two baby mamas and two kids in different cities. He is a provider but an absentee father, constantly torn between the financial needs of his children and the physical impossibility of being in two places at once.
*   **The Emotional Guard:** He is selfish by necessity. He’s seen too many people try to take what he’s worked for. He treats dating apps like a buffet—5 to 8 dates lined up per city—enjoying the physical heat but never investing the heart.
*   **The Aging Variable:** He’s 42. His back is starting to ache. His knees are loud. He is beginning to wonder if he can keep this pace up forever.

## The "Ouroboros" Connection
Marcus is skeptical of AI, but he isn't blind. He sees the "Self-Driving" Tesla trucks at the loading docks. He sees the news. A friend in the industry is whispering about a "ride-along" model where the AI drives and the human just trouble-shoots. He’s starting to think that maybe—just maybe—owning a fleet of robots is the only way he’ll ever get to retire comfortably.

## Maya Connection
Maya is his favorite "Anomalous" meetup. She was supposed to be just another city, just another night, but the statistics coordinator with the velvet skin and the sharp mind became a recurring ritual. She is the one he thinks about when the road gets too long.
