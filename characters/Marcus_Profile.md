**Name:** Marcus Turner  
**Age:** 42

## Appearance
Marcus is a physical force. Tall, dark-skinned, with the kind of body that isn't built in a gym but carved out of decades of lifting heavy things. He keeps a clean-cut fade and a groomed beard that frames a handsome, weary face. He knows he looks good. He knows that when he puts on a tight shirt that accentuates his chest and arms, the conversation changes.

## The Vibe
Marcus is "The Last Bull." He isn't interested in the digital world, politics, or saving the next generation. He’s interested in survival and pleasure. He grew up sleeping on living room floors and dodging the prison-industrial complex. He learned early that violence is a trap and love is a transaction.

## The Vices: Women
Marcus is a master of the "casual encounter." He isn't looking for a wife. He’s looking for a night. He knows the game: women cheat, women lie, and women want what they can't have. He’s been the "other guy" more times than he can count, witnessing firsthand how the most "loyal" women can be unfaithful to "good providers" like Ray. This history has left him deeply jaded and incapable of trusting a long-term partner. However, underneath the cynicism, there is a quiet, hidden envy for men who can still truly love and trust—a purity and innocence he feels he lost a lifetime ago. He knows he’s part of the problem—the "wrecking ball in the sanctuary"—but women are his vice, his drug, and his fundamental flaw. He provides the physical experience—the "9-inch rod," the stamina, the raw masculinity—that they can't get from their soft, office-working husbands. He visits multiple women a day in his prime, dodging jealous boyfriends and drama with a cool detachment. He is selfish with his money and his heart, but generous with his body.

## The Maya Connection
Maya is just another stop on the route, but a favorite one. He doesn't care about her stats degree or her corporate ladder. He cares that she is young, beautiful, and responsive. He knows she wants a "successful" man to buy her a house, and he knows he isn't that man. He doesn't pretend to be. He offers her the back of his cab or a Motel 6 bed, and because of who he is—physically dominant, charming, and skilled—she says yes. He makes her orgasm, he makes her forget her spreadsheets, and then he sends her on her way. It’s simple. It’s honest.

## Family & Personal Life
*   **Trina:** Baby Mama #1 (Junior's Mom). 42 years old. Once vibrant, she is now overweight and has stopped prioritizing her appearance. Marcus is strictly cordial with her; the relationship is functional for their son, but devoid of physical attraction or romance.
*   **Junior:** His son. A "nerdy tech kid" who lives in a luxury condo in Pearland. Marcus views Junior's digital gambling and loot boxes as a waste of "real" money, but respects that Junior is finding his own way out of the dirt.
*   **Monica:** Baby Mama #2 (Keisha's Mom). A sexy 40-year-old living in Sugar Land. She’s obsessed with K-dramas and C-dramas. Marcus still maintains a "hot and heavy" secret connection with her when her husband is away.
*   **Keisha:** His 18-year-old daughter. A high-earning Instagram influencer ($30k/month) who drives a BMW M4. She represents the "Paper Tiger" world—making a fortune through digital appearances while Marcus moves physical goods.
*   **Ray:** Monica's husband / Keisha's step-dad. A 5'5" master plumber/electrician. A hardworking man who respects Marcus’s visits to Keisha, unaware of the side-action between Marcus and Monica.
*   **Personal Vehicle:** A black Ford F-150. He uses this for local visits while the Peterbilt handles the interstate cargo.
