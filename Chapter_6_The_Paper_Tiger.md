Chapter 6: The Paper Tiger

The Stacks

Marcus Turner sat in the cab of his Peterbilt, idling in a rest stop just outside of Charlotte. The rain hammered against the roof, a relentless, metallic drumming that matched the low thrum of the engine beneath his seat. It was a sound he felt more than he heard—a vibration that settled deep in his bones, reminding him of the sheer weight he was controlling.

He was forty-two years old, and he felt every mile of it.

In his glovebox, secured with a thick rubber band, sat twenty thousand dollars in cash. It was his insurance policy, his retirement fund, his peace of mind. Marcus didn't trust numbers on a screen. You couldn't delete a rubber band. You couldn't hack a hundred-dollar bill. In a world that was becoming increasingly obsessed with ghosts, Marcus trusted only what he could touch.

Outside the rain-streaked window, he watched a kid in a white Tesla parked two spots over. The car looked less like a vehicle and more like a high-end appliance. Inside, the kid’s face was illuminated by the pale blue glow of a smartphone. He was laughing, tapping the screen with a frantic energy.

Marcus’s own phone buzzed in the cup holder. It was his son, Junior.

"Dad, you see the ticker? We’re hitting the moon," Junior said the moment Marcus answered. His voice was breathless, vibrating with the same manic energy as the kid in the Tesla. "I’m up to a hundred and six thousand. I’m cashing out twenty. I already put fifteen down on that condo in Pearland—the one with the smart-lock and the floor-to-ceiling glass. And I bought you that new electric rig, the one with the sleeper suite and the massage chair. It’s coming to the yard on Tuesday. You shouldn't be breaking your back in that old rattle-trap anymore. It’s not efficient."

*Efficient.* The word tasted like copper in Marcus's mouth.

"I don't need a massage chair, Junior," Marcus said, his voice a low rumble, though a small part of him felt a flicker of pride. "I need you to not lose the principal. That hundred thousand is a ghost until you put it in a rubber band. You hear me?"

"You don't get it, Dad," Junior said, a trace of pity in his voice. "A rubber band is a liability. Inflation is eating your cash while I’m holding the line. I lost twenty on Dogecoin last week, yeah, but I made seventy-five on Bitcoin this morning. We’re taking it back from the suits. It’s just numbers, Pop. Just numbers on a screen."

Marcus hung up, his head spinning. He finished his run, dropped his trailer at the Houston yard, and swapped the massive Peterbilt for his black Ford F-150. He decided to see it for himself. He steered the pickup toward Junior’s new zip code in Pearland, the truck feeling much more at home in the manicured suburban streets than the eighteen-wheeler ever would.

Junior’s condo was a glass-and-steel cube that looked like it belonged in a sci-fi movie. Inside, the air smelled of expensive cologne and ozone. Marcus sat on a couch that cost more than his first three trucks, watching Junior play a football game on a screen that took up half the wall.

"Watch this, Pop," Junior said, his eyes fixed on the screen. He wasn't even playing a game; he was in a menu. He clicked a button, and a digital box exploded into a shower of gold light and confetti. "Let's go... come on, skibidi toilet luck... damn. Another bronze pack."

"What did you just do?" Marcus asked.

"Loot box," Junior muttered, his thumb already hovering over the 'Buy Again' button. "I’m trying to pull the Legendary Mahomes card. It’s a one-in-a-thousand drop. Each pack is fifty bucks."

Marcus watched as Junior clicked again. Another fifty dollars vanished into the ether. Confetti. Disappointment. Another click. Another fifty.

"You just spent a hundred and fifty dollars in three minutes," Marcus said, his voice dropping an octave. "For a picture of a man on a screen?"

"It’s not just a picture, Dad, it’s an asset," Junior said, not looking away. "If I pull the Legendary, I can flip it on the secondary market for two grand. It’s all about the algorithm. We’re in a bull run, Pop. You gotta spend to yield. Money isn't paper anymore. It’s just energy moving between servers."

Marcus looked at his son—the kid he’d raised on grease and grit—and felt a cold distance. Junior was a hybrid of a tech bro and a gambler, his brain rewired by years of Reddit memes, GameStop rallies, and the dopamine loops of TikTok. To Junior, the twenty-thousand in the Peterbilt’s glovebox wasn't security; it was "inefficient energy." 

He thought about Junior's mother, Trina. She was forty-two, the same age as Marcus, but the years hadn't been as kind to her. She’d grown heavy, her once-sharp features softened by a sedentary life and a resignation that Marcus couldn't relate to. When he dropped by to see Junior, he was always cordial—a polite nod, a brief check-in about the bills—but the fire had gone out of that connection a decade ago. He stayed for the kid, but he lived for the road.

The Family Business

A week later, Marcus found himself in a different kind of suburban dream. He pulled his personal Ford truck into a driveway in a quiet, wealthy pocket of Sugar Land. The house was a sprawling three-bedroom ranch, paid off and perfect.

Monica, his second baby mama, was on the porch. She was forty and looked like she hadn't aged a day since twenty-five. She was wearing a tight athletic set that showed off every curve, her hair a cascade of deep red curls. She had a mug of steaming coffee in one hand and her phone in the other, her eyes glued to a Chinese drama playing on the screen.

"Marcus," she said, not looking up. "Keisha’s in the garage. Try not to track mud in."

Marcus walked past her, the scent of her perfume—something expensive and floral—hitting him like a memory. Inside, the house was silent except for the melodic chirping of the TV show. 

He found Keisha, his twenty-one-year-old daughter, buffing the hood of a white BMW M4. She looked exactly like her mother, but with an edge of modern polish that felt sharp enough to cut.

"Hey, big head," Keisha said, giving him a quick, one-armed hug. "You like the new whip? Picked it up yesterday."

"How much?" Marcus asked, leaning against the workbench.

"Eighty-five. Cash," Keisha said, her eyes gleaming. "I did a three-post deal with a luxury hair brand. Thirty-five K for a weekend of 'content.' I’m an Instagram model, Dad. I don't just take pictures; I move markets. I’m making thirty a month, easy."

Marcus looked at the car, then at his daughter. She was doing better than he was, and she’d never had grease under her fingernails in her life. 

"Where’s... what’s his name?" Marcus asked.

"Ray? He’s on a job," Keisha said. "Big plumbing contract for a new development. He’s a hard worker, Dad. He trusts Mom to the max. He doesn't care that you visit."

Ray was the step-dad. Five-foot-five, built like a fire hydrant, and smarter than he looked. He was a master plumber and electrician with his own crew. He was the kind of man Marcus respected—blue collar, honest, and completely oblivious.

"I’m gonna go say bye to your mom," Marcus said.

He walked back into the house. Keisha had gone back to her car. Monica was still on the couch, the coffee long gone, her eyes still on the screen. She looked bored. Vulnerable.

Marcus stood behind the couch. He didn't say a word. He just reached down and ran a hand over the slope of her shoulder. She didn't flinch. She just sighed, a long, low sound that told him everything he needed to know.

"Ray won't be back for three hours," she whispered.

Marcus didn't need a second invitation. He’d always been a man who knew how to speak a good game, but with Monica, he didn't need words. He just needed history. He pulled her up, his hands finding the weight of her, the big, firm butt that had always been his weakness. 

He led her to the bedroom, the K-drama still playing in the other room. He didn't do "gentle" with her either. He took her right there, his hands gripping her hips as she rode him, her head thrown back, her moans muffled by the expensive pillows. He grabbed her breasts, his thumbs twisting her nipples as he pounded her sideways, their bodies a tangle of heat and past mistakes. 

He flipped her over, putting her in doggy, his rhythm relentless until she was shaking under him. He felt the crescendo building, a raw, primal surge that he didn't try to stop. He crescendos, splurging on her back, the heat of it a stark contrast to the air-conditioned silence of the house.

Panting, Monica reached for the edge of the bed. She was already coming back to her senses, the "mom" mask sliding back into place. 

"Shower," she muttered, not looking at him. "You need to go, Marcus."

"Yeah," Marcus said, pulling on his jeans. "I'm gone."

He was back in his Ford truck before the shower had even stopped running. He drove away, the suburban perfection of Sugar Land blurring in his mirrors. He felt a strange mix of triumph and disgust. He was the king of his own little world, but the borders were getting smaller every day.

Marcus didn't judge Ray. If anything, he felt a quiet, hollow ache of envy. He watched the way Ray worked, the way he came home and kissed Monica with a sincerity that was as solid as the pipes he laid. Ray had an innocence that Marcus had lost a lifetime ago—the ability to truly love a woman, to trust her, to believe that a home was a sanctuary rather than a stage. 

In his younger days, Marcus had been the "other guy" more times than he could count. He was the secret in the phone, the shadow in the bedroom when the "good man" was out working a double shift to pay for the granite countertops. He’d seen the most "loyal" women crumble for a few hours of the raw physicality he brought to the table. It had left him with a deep, jagged cynicism that no amount of church-going or self-help could smooth over. He didn't trust relationships because he knew how easily they could be picked apart from the outside. He was part of the problem, the wrecking ball in the sanctuary, but he couldn't help it. Women were his vice, his drug, his fatal flaw. He needed the touch of them to feel alive, but as he watched Ray's truck in the distance, he knew he was the one truly wandering. He was the king of the road, but Ray was the king of a home.

The Buffet

Marcus leaned back in the booth at the Flying J, watching his coworker, Slim, swipe through his phone with the focus of a bomb disposal technician. Slim was fifty, with a gut that hung over his belt and a marriage that had been dead for a decade.

"Forget Hinge, Marc," Slim said, shoving the phone in Marcus’s face. "You need BLK. It’s like a digital menu. Look at this one in Memphis. Says she loves 'experienced' men. I got her lined up for Tuesday."

Marcus looked at the glowing rectangle with a mix of suspicion and genuine wonder. He was a man who still bought paper maps for the back-roads. "You mean all these women are just... sitting there? In the phone? Like they're waiting for a call?"

"Better," Slim laughed, his eyes glued to the screen. "They're waiting for a swipe. Swipe right if you like 'em, left if you don't. It's like a buffet that never closes, man. Everybody’s at home doing this now. If you want to get laid in this new world, you gotta go where the eyes are."

Reluctantly, Marcus installed the app. He uploaded a photo of himself in a tight black tee, one that accentuated the results of twenty years of heavy lifting. He kept his beard groomed to a razor edge. He knew what he was. He was a relic, but he was a well-preserved one. A king among peasants who spent their lives in chairs.

At first, the profiles were a blur of average faces—women he’d see at a gas station or a diner. He swiped right on a few, thinking of it as a polite nod. "Okay, she seems nice," he muttered. "Her too."

But as he sat in the booth, the app seemed to be... learning. The women started getting younger. Their skin started looking smoother. The "average" faces disappeared, replaced by a steady stream of mahogany-skinned queens with hourglass figures and smiles that looked like they belonged on billboards. 

"Damn," Marcus whispered, his thumb moving with a new urgency. "Look at this one. And this one. Slim, are all these girls really in Memphis? It's like they're getting better the more I look."

"The jackpot," Slim grinned, not looking up. "The app knows what you want before you do, Marc. Just keep swiping."

It felt... easy. Dangerously easy. Marcus didn't suspect the filters, the bots, or the professional cat-fishers lurking behind the pixels. To him, it was just a miracle of modern science—a list of real women who were all, apparently, interested in a man like him. The dopamine hit was instant, a rush of digital validation that competed with the adrenaline of the road. 

For the next hundred miles, he drove with one hand on the wheel and one hand on the phone. *Swipe. Swipe. Swipe.* He lined up options like he lined up cargo. A teacher in Knoxville. A nurse in Chattanooga. An "Influencer" in Atlanta.

But the reality hit back hard.

The teacher in Knoxville was a hundred pounds heavier than her photo, smelling of stale cigarettes and a deep, quiet desperation. The "Influencer" in Atlanta wasn't even the person in the profile; she was using a cousin's photos to score a free dinner.

Marcus didn't complain. He was a bull. He was there for the physical. He took what was offered, providing the experience they craved—the strength, the stamina, the raw masculinity they couldn't get from the "soft" men in their DMs. He left them satisfied, but as he drove away, he felt a growing cynicism. The whole world felt like a paper tiger. Beautiful from a distance, but made of nothing but thin, flammable lies.

The Jackpot

Then he saw her.

Maya.

Her profile was different. No filters. No demands about "High Value Men." No lists of requirements that read like a ransom note—*If you ain't spending, don't message me.* Just a woman with a luminous, warm mahogany complexion and braided locs that looked like they were spun from silk. She was wearing a blazer that suggested she lived in a corporate world Marcus wouldn't understand, but her eyes held a depth that stopped his thumb mid-swipe.

"I’m looking for something that isn't a simulation," her bio read.

Marcus replied: "I’m in town for forty-eight hours. I don't do simulations."

They met at *The Capital Grille*. Marcus knew the game. You didn't invite a woman like Maya to a motel; you invited her to an experience. He’d showered at the Flying J, scrubbing the grease from his hands with Pumice until they were raw, and changed into the charcoal button-down and slacks he kept pressed in the sleeper cab. 

When she walked in, Marcus felt his breath hitch. She was a physical force. The way she moved, the way she looked him in the eye without blinking—it was a challenge. 

He didn't talk about the road. He talked about the world. He charmed her with the quiet confidence of a man who had seen everything between coastlines. Maya watched him over the rim of her martini, eyeing the way his shirt stretched across his chest, the way his hands—clean now, but still thick and capable—held the glass.

"You look like trouble," she said, a smile playing on her lips.

"I'm only trouble if you're looking for safe," Marcus replied, his voice a low rumble.

Two hours and three rounds later, they were in the elevator at the Marriott. Marcus held a bottle of Casamigos Reposado in one hand, the seal already broken. Maya stood next to him, her carry-on bag slung over her shoulder—she’d grabbed it from her trunk, prepared for an overnight stay but claiming it was "just in case." Inside was a change of clothes and a Jenga set—a drinking game version she’d bought for a bachelorette party but never used.

"One block," she whispered as the doors closed, eyeing the tequila bottle. "Take a shot. Tell a truth."

In the room, the game didn't last long. The tower fell on the fourth turn, scattering wooden blocks across the generic hotel carpet. They both laughed, the sound warm and easy in the sterile air.

Marcus reached for her. He pulled her against him, his hands finding the smooth obsidian of her skin. He felt the heat of her, the real, physical heat that no app could simulate. She smelled like vanilla and intelligence. 

He pressed close against her, his body a solid wall of heat. Maya ran her hand up his muscular chest, feeling the hard muscle beneath the shirt, before sliding it down his pants to feel the heavy bulge waiting for her. Marcus looked down deep into her eyes, holding her gaze as he kissed her—a slow, claiming pressure that made her knees weak. He ran his hands down her back and slipped them into her panties, his fingers finding her clitoris and the entrance to her vagina. She was dry at first, but under his touch, she slowly began to get wet, her breath hitching into a soft moan.

He stepped back, breaking the contact but holding her gaze. Maya’s hands went to his shirt, her fingers fumbling slightly as she undid the buttons. She pushed the charcoal fabric off his shoulders, revealing the broad, scarred expanse of his chest and arms—a landscape of muscle carved by labor. Marcus didn't wait. He stripped off her blazer, then unzipped her dress with a single, fluid motion, letting it pool at her feet. She stood before him in lacy black lingerie that contrasted sharply with her mahogany skin. He kicked off his slacks and boxers, revealing the heavy, thick erection that had been teasing her all night. Maya’s eyes widened, her breath catching as she took in the sheer size of him.

He pushed her onto the bed, his body a weight that she welcomed, but as he moved to enter her, she flinched, her hand pressing against his chest.

"Wait," she whispered, her voice tight. "Slow down. It's... it's been a while."

Marcus stopped instantly. He looked down at her, seeing the hesitation in her eyes. She was tight, incredibly so—a product of a generation that spent more time online than in bed. 

"I got you," he rumbled, his voice low and reassuring. "I know exactly how to handle that."

He moved down her body, his hands parting her thighs with a deliberate slowness. He didn't rush. He went to work with the expertise of a man who knew that pleasure was a mechanism with specific inputs. His tongue found her, broad and skilled, teasing out the tension until she was arching off the mattress. He made her come twice, her cries muffled by the hotel duvet, before he even thought about moving.

Then he turned her over. "Head down, butt up," he commanded softly.

She obeyed, trembling. Marcus didn't just focus on the obvious; he rimmed her, his tongue exploring the sensitive skin while he savagely worked her walls and clitoris like a drowning man seeking air. The sensation was overwhelming—a dual assault that left her gasping, her moans turning guttural and raw. She was soaking wet now, her body primed and begging for him.

He flipped her over, pulling her toward the edge of the bed while he stood between her legs. He lifted her ankles, holding them high in a wheelbarrow position, exposing her completely to him. He guided himself into her, slowly, inch by inch. She was still incredibly tight, gripping him like a velvet vice, but the wetness made it possible. He gave her more and more, watching her face contort in pleasure as she took him deeper.

"That's it," he groaned, the friction becoming too much. "Take it."

He couldn't hold back. The tightness, the heat, the way she looked up at him with those wide, trusting eyes—it broke his control. He pulled out at the last second, his release hitting her belly and chest in thick, white ropes. 

They collapsed for a moment, the room spinning from the Casamigos and the adrenaline. Maya was panting, her chest heaving, her skin glistening.

"You ready for round two?" she whispered, a mischievous glint returning to her eyes.

Before he could answer, she moved. She started sucking him, her mouth hot and eager, getting him nice and lubricated. She took him deep, her tongue swirling, then moved to take his testicles in her mouth, working them with a dedication that made Marcus grip the sheets. She did this for nearly fifteen minutes, a relentless rhythm of saliva and suction. Marcus watched her, his hand tangling in her locs, rubbing down her back, caressing the curve of her butt. He thought she was going to choke herself, the saliva running down his shaft and balls, but she didn't stop.

Finally, just before he was close to the edge again, she climbed up. She straddled him, sinking down onto him with a gasp. She began to ride him, grinding him into the mattress, her moans building as she found her own rhythm. She reached her orgasm first, her body shuddering violently as she milked him, and the sensation pushed Marcus over the precipice. He released inside her this time, a deep, emptying flood that left him lightheaded.

She collapsed on top of him, her head resting on his chest. They both fell asleep like that—drunk, spent, her never getting off, his penis throbbing softly inside her, his balls sufficiently emptied. The silence in the room was heavy, not with awkwardness, but with the rare, exhausted peace of the truly satisfied.

The Highway

In the morning, Marcus watched her get dressed. She looked professional again. She looked like the corporate star her mother had tutored her to be.

"When will you be back?" she asked, adjusting her blazer.

"As soon as the road lets me," Marcus said. He reached for his pants, feeling the reassuring lump of cash in his wallet. He didn't promise her a picket fence. He didn't promise her the American Dream. He just promised her the truth.

Marcus liked Maya. She was the only "Real" thing he’d found in the digital buffet. 

He drove out of Atlanta, the sun hitting his mirrors. He felt a strange sense of contentment, a rare moment where the world didn't feel like it was trying to sell him a ghost. He thought about Keisha and her eighty-five-thousand-dollar BMW. He thought about Junior and his glass condo. He didn't really understand what an "Instagram model" was, or how moving pixels around on a screen could pay for a life like that, but as long as they were healthy and winning, he wasn't going to lose sleep over the mechanics.

He adjusted his mirrors, his rough hands steady on the wheel. He was a relic, a dinosaur in a world of silicon and electricity, but for now, the road was still his. He didn't see the fire coming. He didn't see the extraction. He just saw the horizon.

Marcus Turner was a relic. He was a dinosaur. And if he didn't catch up with the times, he was just fossil fuel waiting to be spent.
