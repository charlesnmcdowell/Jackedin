Chapter 6: The Paper Tiger

The Stacks

Marcus Turner sat in the cab of his Peterbilt, idling in a rest stop just outside of Charlotte. The rain hammered against the roof, a relentless, metallic drumming that matched the low thrum of the engine beneath his seat. It was a sound he felt more than he heard—a vibration that settled deep in his bones, reminding him of the sheer weight he was controlling.

He was forty-two years old, and he felt every mile of it.

In his glovebox, secured with a thick rubber band, sat twenty thousand dollars in cash. It was his insurance policy, his retirement fund, his peace of mind. Marcus didn't trust numbers on a screen. You couldn't delete a rubber band. You couldn't hack a hundred-dollar bill. In a world that was becoming increasingly obsessed with ghosts, Marcus trusted only what he could touch.

Outside the rain-streaked window, he watched a kid in a white Tesla parked two spots over. The car looked less like a vehicle and more like a high-end appliance. Inside, the kid’s face was illuminated by the pale blue glow of a smartphone. He was laughing, tapping the screen with a frantic energy.

Marcus’s own phone buzzed in the cup holder. It was his son, Junior.

"Dad, you see the ticker? We’re hitting the moon," Junior said the moment Marcus answered. His voice was breathless, vibrating with the same manic energy as the kid in the Tesla. "I’m up to a hundred and six thousand. I’m cashing out twenty. I already put fifteen down on that condo in Pearland—the one with the smart-lock and the floor-to-ceiling glass. And I bought you that new electric rig, the one with the sleeper suite and the massage chair. It’s coming to the yard on Tuesday. You shouldn't be breaking your back in that old rattle-trap anymore. It’s not efficient."

*Efficient.* The word tasted like copper in Marcus's mouth.

"I don't need a massage chair, Junior," Marcus said, his voice a low rumble, though a small part of him felt a flicker of pride. "I need you to not lose the principal. That hundred thousand is a ghost until you put it in a rubber band. You hear me?"

"You don't get it, Dad," Junior said, a trace of pity in his voice. "A rubber band is a liability. Inflation is eating your cash while I’m holding the line. I lost twenty on Dogecoin last week, yeah, but I made seventy-five on Bitcoin this morning. We’re taking it back from the suits. It’s just numbers, Pop. Just numbers on a screen."

Marcus hung up, his head spinning. The math was a shell game he couldn't follow—losing twenty to make seventy-five, all while staring at a glowing rectangle. He was glad his nerdy, tech-obsessed son was finally winning, finally finding a way out of the dirt and the grease, but it felt precarious. Like a castle built on a cloud. A ghost eating a ghost.

The Buffet

Marcus leaned back in the booth at the Flying J, watching his coworker, Slim, swipe through his phone with the focus of a bomb disposal technician. Slim was fifty, with a gut that hung over his belt and a marriage that had been dead for a decade.

"Forget Hinge, Marc," Slim said, shoving the phone in Marcus’s face. "You need BLK. It’s curated. No more guessing. Look at this one in Memphis. Says she loves 'experienced' men. I got her lined up for Tuesday."

Marcus glanced at the screen. The woman was stunning—a high-definition dream with perfect skin and a smile that looked expensive.

"How do you know she's real?" Marcus asked.

"Who cares?" Slim laughed, his eyes glued to the screen. "The bars are empty, man. Everybody’s at home doing this. If you want to get laid in this new world, you gotta go where the eyes are."

Reluctantly, Marcus installed the app. He uploaded a photo of himself in a tight black tee, one that accentuated the results of twenty years of heavy lifting. He kept his beard groomed to a razor edge. He knew what he was. He was a relic, but he was a well-preserved one. A king among peasants who spent their lives in chairs.

He swiped right. A match instantly.
He swiped again. Match.

It felt... easy. Dangerously easy. It was like pulling the lever on a slot machine that was rigged to pay out. The dopamine hit was instant, a rush of digital validation that competed with the adrenaline of the road.

For the next hundred miles, he drove with one hand on the wheel and one hand on the phone. *Swipe. Swipe. Swipe.* He lined up options like he lined up cargo. A teacher in Knoxville. A nurse in Chattanooga. An "Influencer" in Atlanta.

But the reality hit back hard.

The teacher in Knoxville was a hundred pounds heavier than her photo, smelling of stale cigarettes and a deep, quiet desperation. The "Influencer" in Atlanta wasn't even the person in the profile; she was using a cousin's photos to score a free dinner.

Marcus didn't complain. He was a bull. He was there for the physical. He took what was offered, providing the experience they craved—the strength, the stamina, the raw masculinity they couldn't get from the "soft" men in their DMs. He left them satisfied, but as he drove away, he felt a growing cynicism. The whole world felt like a paper tiger. Beautiful from a distance, but made of nothing but thin, flammable lies.

The Jackpot

Then he saw her.

Maya.

Her profile was different. No filters. No "To the moon" emojis. Just a woman with a luminous, warm mahogany complexion and braided locs that looked like they were spun from silk. She was wearing a blazer that suggested she lived in a corporate world Marcus wouldn't understand, but her eyes held a depth that stopped his thumb mid-swipe.

"I’m looking for something that isn't a simulation," she messaged.

Marcus replied: "I’m in town for forty-eight hours. I got a room at the Marriott. I don't do simulations."

He met her in the lobby. For the first time in his life, Marcus felt his breath hitch.

She was better than the photos. She was a physical force. The way she moved, the way she looked him in the eye without blinking—it was a challenge. 

He took her up to the room. He didn't ask about her stats. He didn't ask about her career. He just wanted to feel the weight of her.

He pulled her against him, his rough, grease-stained hands finding the smooth obsidian of her skin. He felt the heat of her, the real, physical heat that no app could simulate. She smelled like vanilla and intelligence. 

Marcus didn't do "gentle" well. He was a man of torque and tension. He lifted her off her feet, her legs wrapping around his waist as he pinned her against the Marriott’s beige wallpaper. He could feel her heart racing against his chest, a frantic, human drumbeat. He buried his face in the crook of her neck, his beard rough against her skin, and for a moment, the road, the Peterbilt, and the $20,000 in rubber bands didn't exist.

He pushed her onto the bed, his body a weight that she welcomed with a low, desperate sound. He showed her what twenty years of hard labor felt like when it was channeled into a single purpose. He was methodical, his calloused thumbs tracing the curve of her jaw, his mouth demanding and sure. He made her forget the data. He made her forget the spreadsheets. 

He took her from behind, his large hands gripping her hips, anchoring her to the present. Every deep, rhythmic stroke was a reminder of what was real. He watched the way her muscles tensed, the way her back arched, until the room blurred and she was screaming his name into the pillows, her body shivering under the raw force of him. He stayed in her until the last of the tremors faded, his breath hot against her ear.

The Billboard

In the morning, Marcus watched her get dressed. She looked professional again. She looked like the corporate star her mother had tutored her to be.

"When will you be back?" she asked, adjusting her blazer.

"As soon as the road lets me," Marcus said. He reached for his pants, feeling the reassuring lump of cash in his wallet. He didn't promise her a picket fence. He didn't promise her the American Dream. He just promised her the truth.

He liked Maya. She was the only "Real" thing he’d found in the digital buffet. 

He drove out of Atlanta, the sun hitting his mirrors. He stopped for gas at a high-end station on the edge of the suburbs.

Above the pumps, a massive digital billboard flickered to life.

It was a woman in a bikini, lounging by a pool that looked too blue to be real. Her skin was flawless. Her smile was a million-dollar invitation. The text read: *“Follow Keisha_B for the Lifestyle You Deserve.”*

Marcus froze, the gas nozzle heavy in his hand.

It was her.

Keisha. His daughter. 

She had 1.5 million followers. She was an "Influencer." She was a "Content Creator." She was a paper tiger, selling a version of herself to millions of strangers while her father moved produce across state lines to pay for a life she was pretending to lead.

He looked at the billboard, then at the grease under his own fingernails. 

The match was lit. The world was waiting to burn.

Marcus Turner was a relic. He was a dinosaur. And he was starting to feel the heat.
