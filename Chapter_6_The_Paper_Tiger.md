Chapter 6: The Paper Tiger

The Stacks

Marcus Turner sat in the cab of his Peterbilt, idling in a rest stop just outside of Charlotte. The rain hammered against the roof, a relentless, metallic drumming that matched the low thrum of the engine beneath his seat. It was a sound he felt more than he heard—a vibration that settled deep in his bones, reminding him of the sheer weight he was controlling.

He was forty-two years old, and he felt every mile of it.

In his glovebox, secured with a thick rubber band, sat twenty thousand dollars in cash. It was his insurance policy, his retirement fund, his peace of mind. Marcus didn't trust numbers on a screen. You couldn't delete a rubber band. You couldn't hack a hundred-dollar bill. In a world that was becoming increasingly obsessed with ghosts, Marcus trusted only what he could touch.

Outside the rain-streaked window, he watched a kid in a white Tesla parked two spots over. The car looked less like a vehicle and more like a high-end appliance. Inside, the kid’s face was illuminated by the pale blue glow of a smartphone. He was laughing, tapping the screen with a frantic energy.

Marcus’s own phone buzzed in the cup holder. It was his son, Junior.

"Dad, you see the ticker? We’re hitting the moon," Junior said the moment Marcus answered. His voice was breathless, vibrating with the same manic energy as the kid in the Tesla. "I’m up to a hundred and six thousand. I’m cashing out twenty. I already put fifteen down on that condo in Pearland—the one with the smart-lock and the floor-to-ceiling glass. And I bought you that new electric rig, the one with the sleeper suite and the massage chair. It’s coming to the yard on Tuesday. You shouldn't be breaking your back in that old rattle-trap anymore. It’s not efficient."

*Efficient.* The word tasted like copper in Marcus's mouth.

"I don't need a massage chair, Junior," Marcus said, his voice a low rumble, though a small part of him felt a flicker of pride. "I need you to not lose the principal. That hundred thousand is a ghost until you put it in a rubber band. You hear me?"

"You don't get it, Dad," Junior said, a trace of pity in his voice. "A rubber band is a liability. Inflation is eating your cash while I’m holding the line. I lost twenty on Dogecoin last week, yeah, but I made seventy-five on Bitcoin this morning. We’re taking it back from the suits. It’s just numbers, Pop. Just numbers on a screen."

Marcus hung up, his head spinning. He decided to see it for himself. He steered the Peterbilt toward Junior’s new zip code in Pearland, the truck feeling like a tank in the manicured suburban streets.

Junior’s condo was a glass-and-steel cube that looked like it belonged in a sci-fi movie. Inside, the air smelled of expensive cologne and ozone. Marcus sat on a couch that cost more than his first three trucks, watching Junior play a football game on a screen that took up half the wall.

"Watch this, Pop," Junior said, his eyes fixed on the screen. He wasn't even playing a game; he was in a menu. He clicked a button, and a digital box exploded into a shower of gold light and confetti. "Come on, come on... damn. Another bronze pack."

"What did you just do?" Marcus asked.

"Loot box," Junior muttered, his thumb already hovering over the 'Buy Again' button. "I’m trying to pull the Legendary Mahomes card. It’s a one-in-a-thousand drop. Each pack is fifty bucks."

Marcus watched as Junior clicked again. Another fifty dollars vanished into the ether. Confetti. Disappointment. Another click. Another fifty.

"You just spent a hundred and fifty dollars in three minutes," Marcus said, his voice dropping an octave. "For a picture of a man on a screen?"

"It’s not just a picture, Dad, it’s an asset," Junior said, not looking away. "If I pull the Legendary, I can flip it on the secondary market for two grand. It’s all about the algorithm. Money isn't paper anymore, Pop. It’s just energy moving between servers."

Marcus looked at his son—the kid he’d raised on grease and grit—and felt a cold distance. To Junior, the twenty-thousand in the Peterbilt’s glovebox wasn't security; it was "inefficient energy." 

He thought about Junior's mother, Trina. She was forty-two, the same age as Marcus, but the years hadn't been as kind to her. She’d grown heavy, her once-sharp features softened by a sedentary life and a resignation that Marcus couldn't relate to. When he dropped by to see Junior, he was always cordial—a polite nod, a brief check-in about the bills—but the fire had gone out of that connection a decade ago. He stayed for the kid, but he lived for the road.

The Family Business

A week later, Marcus found himself in a different kind of suburban dream. He pulled his personal Ford truck into a driveway in a quiet, wealthy pocket of Sugar Land. The house was a sprawling three-bedroom ranch, paid off and perfect.

Monica, his second baby mama, was on the porch. She was forty and looked like she hadn't aged a day since twenty-five. She was wearing a tight athletic set that showed off every curve, her hair a cascade of deep red curls. She had a mug of steaming coffee in one hand and her phone in the other, her eyes glued to a Chinese drama playing on the screen.

"Marcus," she said, not looking up. "Keisha’s in the garage. Try not to track mud in."

Marcus walked past her, the scent of her perfume—something expensive and floral—hitting him like a memory. Inside, the house was silent except for the melodic chirping of the TV show. 

He found Keisha, his eighteen-year-old daughter, buffing the hood of a white BMW M4. She looked exactly like her mother, but with an edge of modern polish that felt sharp enough to cut.

"Hey, big head," Keisha said, giving him a quick, one-armed hug. "You like the new whip? Picked it up yesterday."

"How much?" Marcus asked, leaning against the workbench.

"Eighty-five. Cash," Keisha said, her eyes gleaming. "I did a three-post deal with a luxury hair brand. Thirty-five K for a weekend of 'content.' I’m an Instagram model, Dad. I don't just take pictures; I move markets. I’m making thirty a month, easy."

Marcus looked at the car, then at his daughter. She was doing better than he was, and she’d never had grease under her fingernails in her life. 

"Where’s... what’s his name?" Marcus asked.

"Ray? He’s on a job," Keisha said. "Big plumbing contract for a new development. He’s a hard worker, Dad. He trusts Mom to the max. He doesn't care that you visit."

Ray was the step-dad. Five-foot-five, built like a fire hydrant, and smarter than he looked. He was a master plumber and electrician with his own crew. He was the kind of man Marcus respected—blue collar, honest, and completely oblivious.

"I’m gonna go say bye to your mom," Marcus said.

He walked back into the house. Keisha had gone back to her car. Monica was still on the couch, the coffee long gone, her eyes still on the screen. She looked bored. Vulnerable.

Marcus stood behind the couch. He didn't say a word. He just reached down and ran a hand over the slope of her shoulder. She didn't flinch. She just sighed, a long, low sound that told him everything he needed to know.

"Ray won't be back for three hours," she whispered.

Marcus didn't need a second invitation. He’d always been a man who knew how to speak a good game, but with Monica, he didn't need words. He just needed history. He pulled her up, his hands finding the weight of her, the big, firm butt that had always been his weakness. 

He led her to the bedroom, the K-drama still playing in the other room. He didn't do "gentle" with her either. He took her right there, his hands gripping her hips as she rode him, her head thrown back, her moans muffled by the expensive pillows. He grabbed her breasts, his thumbs twisting her nipples as he pounded her sideways, their bodies a tangle of heat and past mistakes. 

He flipped her over, putting her in doggy, his rhythm relentless until she was shaking under him. He felt the crescendo building, a raw, primal surge that he didn't try to stop. He crescendos, splurging on her back, the heat of it a stark contrast to the air-conditioned silence of the house.

Panting, Monica reached for the edge of the bed. She was already coming back to her senses, the "mom" mask sliding back into place. 

"Shower," she muttered, not looking at him. "You need to go, Marcus."

"Yeah," Marcus said, pulling on his jeans. "I'm gone."

He was back in his Ford truck before the shower had even stopped running. He drove away, the suburban perfection of Sugar Land blurring in his mirrors. He felt a strange mix of triumph and disgust. He was the king of his own little world, but the borders were getting smaller every day.

Marcus didn't judge Ray. If anything, he felt a quiet, hollow ache of envy. He watched the way Ray worked, the way he came home and kissed Monica with a sincerity that was as solid as the pipes he laid. Ray had an innocence that Marcus had lost a lifetime ago—the ability to truly love a woman, to trust her, to believe that a home was a sanctuary rather than a stage. 

In his younger days, Marcus had been the "other guy" more times than he could count. He was the secret in the phone, the shadow in the bedroom when the "good man" was out working a double shift to pay for the granite countertops. He’d seen the most "loyal" women crumble for a few hours of the raw physicality he brought to the table. It had left him with a deep, jagged cynicism that no amount of church-going or self-help could smooth over. He didn't trust relationships because he knew how easily they could be picked apart from the outside. He was part of the problem, the wrecking ball in the sanctuary, but he couldn't help it. Women were his vice, his drug, his fatal flaw. He needed the touch of them to feel alive, but as he watched Ray's truck in the distance, he knew he was the one truly wandering. He was the king of the road, but Ray was the king of a home.

The Buffet

Marcus leaned back in the booth at the Flying J, watching his coworker, Slim, swipe through his phone with the focus of a bomb disposal technician. Slim was fifty, with a gut that hung over his belt and a marriage that had been dead for a decade.

"Forget Hinge, Marc," Slim said, shoving the phone in Marcus’s face. "You need BLK. It’s curated. No more guessing. Look at this one in Memphis. Says she loves 'experienced' men. I got her lined up for Tuesday."

Marcus glanced at the screen. The woman was stunning—a high-definition dream with perfect skin and a smile that looked expensive.

"How do you know she's real?" Marcus asked.

"Who cares?" Slim laughed, his eyes glued to the screen. "The bars are empty, man. Everybody’s at home doing this. If you want to get laid in this new world, you gotta go where the eyes are."

Reluctantly, Marcus installed the app. He uploaded a photo of himself in a tight black tee, one that accentuated the results of twenty years of heavy lifting. He kept his beard groomed to a razor edge. He knew what he was. He was a relic, but he was a well-preserved one. A king among peasants who spent their lives in chairs.

He swiped right. A match instantly.
He swiped again. Match.

It felt... easy. Dangerously easy. It was like pulling the lever on a slot machine that was rigged to pay out. The dopamine hit was instant, a rush of digital validation that competed with the adrenaline of the road.

For the next hundred miles, he drove with one hand on the wheel and one hand on the phone. *Swipe. Swipe. Swipe.* He lined up options like he lined up cargo. A teacher in Knoxville. A nurse in Chattanooga. An "Influencer" in Atlanta.

But the reality hit back hard.

The teacher in Knoxville was a hundred pounds heavier than her photo, smelling of stale cigarettes and a deep, quiet desperation. The "Influencer" in Atlanta wasn't even the person in the profile; she was using a cousin's photos to score a free dinner.

Marcus didn't complain. He was a bull. He was there for the physical. He took what was offered, providing the experience they craved—the strength, the stamina, the raw masculinity they couldn't get from the "soft" men in their DMs. He left them satisfied, but as he drove away, he felt a growing cynicism. The whole world felt like a paper tiger. Beautiful from a distance, but made of nothing but thin, flammable lies.

The Jackpot

Then he saw her.

Maya.

Her profile was different. No filters. No "To the moon" emojis. Just a woman with a luminous, warm mahogany complexion and braided locs that looked like they were spun from silk. She was wearing a blazer that suggested she lived in a corporate world Marcus wouldn't understand, but her eyes held a depth that stopped his thumb mid-swipe.

"I’m looking for something that isn't a simulation," she messaged.

Marcus replied: "I’m in town for forty-eight hours. I got a room at the Marriott. I don't do simulations."

He met her in the lobby. For the first time in his life, Marcus felt his breath hitch.

She was better than the photos. She was a physical force. The way she moved, the way she looked him in the eye without blinking—it was a challenge. 

He took her up to the room. He didn't ask about her stats. He didn't ask about her career. He just wanted to feel the weight of her.

He pulled her against him, his rough, grease-stained hands finding the smooth obsidian of her skin. He felt the heat of her, the real, physical heat that no app could simulate. She smelled like vanilla and intelligence. 

Marcus didn't do "gentle" well. He was a man of torque and tension. He lifted her off her feet, her legs wrapping around his waist as he pinned her against the Marriott’s beige wallpaper. He could feel her heart racing against his chest, a frantic, human drumbeat. He buried his face in the crook of her neck, his beard rough against her skin, and for a moment, the road, the Peterbilt, and the $20,000 in rubber bands didn't exist.

He pushed her onto the bed, his body a weight that she welcomed with a low, desperate sound. He showed her what twenty years of hard labor felt like when it was channeled into a single purpose. He was methodical, his calloused thumbs tracing the curve of her jaw, his mouth demanding and sure. He made her forget the data. He made her forget the spreadsheets. 

He took her from behind, his large hands gripping her hips, anchoring her to the present. Every deep, rhythmic stroke was a reminder of what was real. He watched the way her muscles tensed, the way her back arched, until the room blurred and she was screaming his name into the pillows, her body shivering under the raw force of him. He stayed in her until the last of the tremors faded, his breath hot against her ear.

The Billboard

In the morning, Marcus watched her get dressed. She looked professional again. She looked like the corporate star her mother had tutored her to be.

"When will you be back?" she asked, adjusting her blazer.

"As soon as the road lets me," Marcus said. He reached for his pants, feeling the reassuring lump of cash in his wallet. He didn't promise her a picket fence. He didn't promise her the American Dream. He just promised her the truth.

He liked Maya. She was the only "Real" thing he’d found in the digital buffet. 

He drove out of Atlanta, the sun hitting his mirrors. He stopped for gas at a high-end station on the edge of the suburbs.

Above the pumps, a massive digital billboard flickered to life.

It was a woman in a bikini, lounging by a pool that looked too blue to be real. Her skin was flawless. Her smile was a million-dollar invitation. The text read: *“Follow Keisha_B for the Lifestyle You Deserve.”*

Marcus froze, the gas nozzle heavy in his hand.

It was her.

Keisha. His daughter. 

She had 1.5 million followers. She was an "Influencer." She was a "Content Creator." She was a paper tiger, selling a version of herself to millions of strangers while her father moved produce across state lines to pay for a life she was pretending to lead.

He looked at the billboard, then at the grease under his own fingernails. 

The match was lit. The world was waiting to burn.

Marcus Turner was a relic. He was a dinosaur. And he was starting to feel the heat.
