Chapter 6: The Paper Tiger

The Stacks

Marcus Turner is a relic. Marcus Turner is a dinosaur. Marcus Turner is a man of weight.

It is eighteen months before the world turned into a deepfake. Before the strobe lights and the Panopticon. Right now, the world is just a bubble, and everyone is trying to float.

Marcus sits in the cab of his Peterbilt, idling in a rest stop outside of Charlotte. The engine thrums under his seat, a rhythmic vibration that he feels in his prostate. It’s a physical sound. A real sound.

In his glovebox, there is twenty thousand dollars in rubber-banded hundreds. This is the only math Marcus trusts. You can’t delete a rubber band. You can’t hack a hundred-dollar bill.

Outside the window, the world is obsessed with ghosts.

"Dad, you gotta get in on this," his son, Junior, had told him on the phone yesterday. Junior is twenty-one. Junior works in a cubicle somewhere in Nashville, answering phones for people whose internet is broken. "I put ten grand of my savings into GameStop. I’m up to a hundred and six thousand. To the moon, Dad. Literally to the moon."

"Ten grand of real money?" Marcus had asked, his voice a low rumble.

"It’s all real, Dad. It’s the new world. It’s a short squeeze. We’re taking it back from the suits."

Marcus didn't understand short squeezes. He understood fuel surcharges. He understood the ache in his lower back after a sixteen-hour haul. He understood that when something sounds too good to be true, someone is usually getting their pocket picked.

"Just don't lose the principal," Marcus said.

"I can't lose. The internet says we're holding the line."

Junior lost twenty grand on Dogecoin two weeks later. A ghost eating a ghost.

The Buffet

Marcus is forty-two. Marcus is six-foot-two. Marcus is two hundred and twenty pounds of lean muscle and scarred knuckles.

His coworker, a guy named Slim who spent too much time staring at his phone, showed him the future.

"It’s called Hinge, Marc," Slim said, tapping the screen. "You set the location to where you're headed. By the time you park the rig, you got three dates lined up. No more bars. No more guessing."

Marcus looked at the screen. The women were stunning. They were high-definition dreams. They had perfect skin, perfect hair, and teeth that looked like they cost more than Marcus’s first truck.

"This is real?" Marcus asked.

"As real as it gets," Slim said.

Marcus installed the app. He uploaded a photo of himself in a tight black tee, his biceps straining against the sleeves, his beard groomed to a razor edge. He looked like a king among peasants.

The hits came instantly.

First was a woman in Knoxville. "I love a man who knows how to handle a big machine," she messaged. Her photo showed a petite blonde in a sundress.

Marcus met her at a diner near the exit. She was a hundred pounds heavier than her photo. She smelled like stale cigarettes and desperation. 

Next was a "Latina Queen" in Atlanta. Marcus showed up at the hotel bar. The woman who met him wasn't even the person in the profile. She was a different person entirely, using a cousin's photos to harvest a free dinner and a night in a room he’d already paid for.

Marcus didn't complain. He was a bull. He was there for the physical. He took what was offered, gave them the "nine-inch treatment" until they were screaming his name, and then he was back on the road before the sun came up. 

He saw the lies. He saw the scams. He saw how real people created stories to reshape their own worth. 

He was beginning to think the whole world was a paper tiger. Beautiful from a distance, but made of nothing but thin, flammable lies.

The Jackpot

Then he saw her.

Maya. 

The profile said she was twenty-three. The profile said she was a Statistics Coordinator. The photos showed a woman with a luminous, warm mahogany complexion and braided locs that looked like they were made of silk. She was wearing a blazer that suggested she had a life Marcus wouldn't understand.

She didn't use emojis. She didn't use slang.

"I’m looking for something that isn't a simulation," she messaged.

Marcus replied: "I’m in town for forty-eight hours. I got a room at the Marriott. I don't do simulations."

He met her in the lobby. For the first time in his life, Marcus Turner felt his breath hitch.

She was better than the photos. She was a physical force. The way she moved, the way she looked him in the eye without blinking—it was a challenge. A beautiful, dangerous challenge.

He took her up to the room. He didn't ask about her stats. He didn't ask about her career. 

He pulled her against him, his rough hands finding the smooth obsidian of her skin. He felt the heat of her, the real, physical heat that no app could simulate. She smelled like vanilla and intelligence. 

He pushed her onto the bed, his body a weight that she welcomed. He showed her what twenty years of hard labor felt like when it was directed at pleasure. He made her forget the data. He made her forget the spreadsheets. 

He made her scream.

The Extraction

In the morning, Marcus watched her get dressed. She looked professional again. She looked like the corporate star her mother had tutored her to be.

"When will you be back?" she asked, adjusting her blazer.

"As soon as the road lets me," Marcus said. He reached for his pants, the cash in his wallet a reassuring lump in his pocket.

He liked Maya. She was the only "Real" thing he’d found in the digital buffet. But as he watched her walk out the door, he thought about his daughter, Keisha.

Keisha was an "Influencer." Keisha had 1.5 million followers. Marcus didn't know what an influencer did, but he knew she was making more money than he was. He knew she was living in a world of high-definition filters and "sponsored content."

He wondered if Keisha was a paper tiger too. 

He wondered if the whole world was just waiting for a match to be lit.

Marcus Turner is a relic. Marcus Turner is a dinosaur. And Marcus Turner is starting to feel the heat.
