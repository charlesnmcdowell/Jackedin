Chapter 6: The Paper Tiger

The Stacks

Marcus Turner is a relic. Marcus Turner is a dinosaur. Marcus Turner is a man of weight.

It is eighteen months before the world turned into a deepfake. Before the strobe lights and the Panopticon. Right now, the world is just a bubble, and everyone is trying to float.

Marcus sits in the cab of his Peterbilt, idling in a rest stop outside of Charlotte. The air smells like rain, hot asphalt, and the metallic tang of cooling brakes. The engine thrums under his seat, a rhythmic vibration that he feels in his prostate. It’s a physical sound. A real sound.

In his glovebox, there is twenty thousand dollars in rubber-banded hundreds. This is the only math Marcus trusts. You can’t delete a rubber band. You can’t hack a hundred-dollar bill. You can’t "reformat" the physical weight of cash in your palm.

Outside the window, the world is obsessed with ghosts.

He’s watching a kid in the parking lot, maybe twenty years old, sitting in a white Tesla that looks like a high-end refrigerator. The kid is staring at a phone, his face glowing with that familiar, pale blue radiation. He’s laughing. He’s winning. He’s making more in a ten-minute "pump and dump" than Marcus makes hauling thirty tons of produce across three state lines.

The phone in Marcus’s cup holder vibrates. It’s Junior.

"Dad, you see the ticker? We’re hitting the moon," Junior says. His voice is frantic, vibrating with the same energy as the kid in the Tesla. Junior doesn't talk about money like it’s something you work for. He talks about it like it’s a high score in a video game. "I’m up to a hundred and six thousand. I’m thinking about cashing out some of the profit. I want to buy you that new electric rig, the one with the sleeper suite and the massage chair. You shouldn't be breaking your back in that old rattle-trap anymore. It’s not efficient, Dad."

Efficient. The word tastes like copper in Marcus's mouth.

"I don't need a massage chair, Junior," Marcus rumbles. "I need you to not lose the principal. That hundred thousand is a ghost until you put it in a rubber band. You hear me?"

"You don't get it, Dad. A rubber band is a liability. Inflation is eating your cash while I’m holding the line. We’re taking it back from the suits. It’s just numbers, Pop. Just numbers on a screen."

Junior lost twenty thousand on Dogecoin two weeks later. The massage chair became a myth. The retirement rig became a memory. A ghost eating a ghost.

The Buffet

Marcus is forty-two. Marcus is six-foot-two. Marcus is two hundred and twenty pounds of lean muscle and scarred knuckles.

He’s sitting in a booth at a Flying J, watching his coworker, Slim, swipe through his phone like he’s playing a slot machine. Slim is fifty, with a gut that hangs over his belt and a wife who hasn't looked at him in a decade.

"Look at this one, Marc," Slim says, shoving the phone in his face. "Knoxville. Twenty-five. Says she loves 'experienced' men. I got her lined up for Tuesday."

Marcus looks at the screen. The woman is a high-definition dream. Perfect skin, perfect hair, teeth that look like they cost more than Marcus’s first truck.

"How do you know she's real?" Marcus asks.

"Who cares?" Slim laughs, his eyes glued to the screen. "The bars are empty, man. Everybody’s at home doing this. If you want to get laid in this new world, you gotta go where the eyes are."

Marcus installs the app. Reluctantly. He uploads a photo of himself in a tight black tee, his biceps straining against the sleeves, his beard groomed to a razor edge. He looks like a king among peasants. He knows he is a "hot physical specimen." He knows how to put on the outfit that accentuates the tone and the endowment. He knows the smooth words and the charming manner.

The hits come instantly. A notification for every mile he drives.

First was a woman in Knoxville. "I love a man who knows how to handle a big machine," she messaged. Her photo showed a petite blonde in a sundress. 

Marcus met her at a diner near the exit. She was a hundred pounds heavier than her photo. She smelled like stale cigarettes and a deep, quiet desperation. She talked about her "career in influencer marketing," which turned out to be selling weight-loss tea to five hundred bots. Marcus paid for her coffee and left before the second cup.

Next was a "Latina Queen" in Atlanta. Marcus showed up at the hotel bar, his skin smelling of expensive cologne and the faint, underlying scent of diesel. The woman who met him wasn't even the person in the profile. She was a different person entirely, using a cousin's photos to harvest a free dinner and a night in a room he’d already paid for.

Marcus didn't complain. He was a bull. He was there for the physical. He took what was offered, gave them the "nine-inch treatment" until they were screaming his name and clawing at his back, and then he was under the shower, watching the water run gray. He was back on the road before the sun came up, listening to them call home to tell their men they were "running late from work" and that they "loved them."

He saw the lies. He saw the scams. He saw how real people created stories to reshape their own worth. He was beginning to think the whole world was a paper tiger. Beautiful from a distance, but made of nothing but thin, flammable lies.

The Jackpot

Then he saw her.

Maya.

The profile was different. No filters. No "To the moon" emojis. Just a woman with a luminous, warm mahogany complexion and braided locs that looked like they were made of silk. She was wearing a blazer that suggested she had a life Marcus wouldn't understand.

"I’m looking for something that isn't a simulation," she messaged.

Marcus replied: "I’m in town for forty-eight hours. I got a room at the Marriott. I don't do simulations."

He met her in the lobby. For the first time in his life, Marcus Turner felt his breath hitch.

She was better than the photos. She was a physical force. The way she moved, the way she looked him in the eye without blinking—it was a challenge. 

He took her up to the room. He didn't ask about her stats. He didn't ask about her career. He just wanted to feel the weight of her.

He pulled her against him, his rough hands finding the smooth obsidian of her skin. He felt the heat of her, the real, physical heat that no app could simulate. She smelled like vanilla and intelligence. 

He pushed her onto the bed, his body a weight that she welcomed. He showed her what twenty years of hard labor felt like when it was directed at pleasure. He made her forget the data. He made her forget the spreadsheets. He pounded her until the room blurred, until the only thing in the universe was the friction between their bodies and the sound of her gasping for air.

He made her scream. He made her come until she couldn't remember her own name.

The Billboard

In the morning, Marcus watched her get dressed. She looked professional again. She looked like the corporate star her mother had tutored her to be.

"When will you be back?" she asked, adjusting her blazer.

"As soon as the road lets me," Marcus said. He reached for his pants, the cash in his wallet a reassuring lump in his pocket. He didn't promise her a picket fence. He didn't promise her the American Dream. He just promised her the truth.

He liked Maya. She was the only "Real" thing he’d found in the digital buffet. 

He drove out of Atlanta, the sun hitting his mirrors. He stopped for gas at a high-end station on the edge of the suburbs.

Above the pumps, a massive digital billboard flickered. 

It was a woman in a bikini, lounging by a pool that looked too blue to be real. Her skin was flawless. Her smile was a million-dollar invitation. The text read: *“Follow Keisha_B for the Lifestyle You Deserve.”*

Marcus froze, the gas nozzle heavy in his hand.

It was her.

Keisha. His daughter. 

She had 1.5 million followers. She was an "Influencer." She was a "Content Creator." She was a paper tiger, selling a version of herself to millions of strangers while her father moved produce across state lines to pay for a life she was pretending to lead.

He looked at the billboard, then at the grease on his own fingernails. 

The match was lit. The world was waiting to burn.

Marcus Turner is a relic. Marcus Turner is a dinosaur. And Marcus Turner is starting to feel the heat.
