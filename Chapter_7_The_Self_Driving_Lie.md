Chapter 7: The Self-Driving Lie

The Witching Hour

The Interstate 10 corridor stretched out like a black ribbon cutting through the desert night. It was 3:00 AM—the "Witching Hour" for long-haulers. This was the time when the caffeine crash hit, when the white lines started to hypnotize you, and when the shadows at the edge of your headlights started to look like things they weren't.

Marcus Turner loved it.

He was back in the Peterbilt, the familiar vibration of the diesel engine humming through the soles of his boots. The cabin smelled of stale coffee and Black Ice air freshener. This was his cockpit, his sanctuary. He had 40,000 pounds of frozen poultry in the reefer unit behind him, due in Phoenix by sunrise.

He checked his mirrors. Clear.
He checked his gauges. Oil pressure steady. Temp good.

For twenty years, Marcus had owned this road. He knew every pothole between Memphis and Los Angeles. He knew where the cops sat in Las Cruces and where the lot lizards worked in El Paso. He was a predator in a world of prey, a man who moved heavy iron with the precision of a surgeon.

But tonight, the road felt different.

It started as a glow in his rearview mirror. LED lights. Bright. Blue-white. Too steady.

Usually, headlights bounced. They jittered with the imperfections of the asphalt and the micro-adjustments of a human hand on the wheel. These lights didn't jitter. They cut through the darkness like lasers, fixed and unblinking.

Marcus narrowed his eyes, shifting in his air-ride seat. "What the hell?"

The vehicle behind him was closing the gap. Fast. It wasn't speeding, exactly; it was *optimizing*. It was maintaining a perfect aerodynamic draft distance, sitting right in Marcus's wake to save fuel. It was too close—way too close for a human driver at seventy miles an hour.

"Back off, cowboy," Marcus muttered. He tapped his brakes, a universal signal to give some space.

The lights didn't flinch. They adjusted instantly, maintaining the exact same distance, down to the inch.

Marcus felt a prickle of cold sweat on the back of his neck. He downshifted, letting the engine brake roar, dropping his speed to sixty.

The vehicle behind him matched the deceleration perfectly. No lag. No reaction time. Just instant, mathematical synchronization.

Marcus swore and punched the gas, the Peterbilt surging forward, black smoke pouring from the stacks. He pushed it to seventy-five, then eighty. The rig rattled, the wind howling against the mirrors.

The lights stayed with him. A predator attached to his shadow.

The Ghost Fleet

Marcus checked his side mirror as the vehicle finally made its move to pass.

It was a Tesla Semi. Sleek, silver, and silent. It looked less like a truck and more like a giant, angry iPhone on wheels. There were no smokestacks. No grille. Just a smooth, aerodynamic nose designed by a wind tunnel.

As it pulled alongside, Marcus looked down into the cab, ready to flip the driver off, ready to scream at some rookie steering-wheel holder for tailgating him.

The cab was empty.

Marcus’s breath hitched. The driver’s seat was vacant. The dashboard was a glowing array of screens, casting a ghostly blue light over an empty chair. There was no one there. No safety driver. No human.

It was a Ghost.

The truck wasn't alone. Behind it, spaced with terrifying precision, were three more. A platoon. They moved as a single organism, a centipede of steel and silicon connected by invisible tethers of Wi-Fi and LIDAR.

They were drafting each other so closely that a sheet of paper couldn't fit between their bumpers. They were creating an aerodynamic wall, cutting wind resistance to near zero.

*Efficiency,* Junior’s voice echoed in his head.

Marcus watched them pass, his grip white-knuckle tight on the wheel. They didn't drift in the lane. They didn't sway. They traced the center line like it was a rail. On the roof of the lead truck, a LIDAR array spun wildly, painting the world in millions of laser points per second. It saw the road. It saw the potholes. It saw Marcus.
But it didn't *see* him. To the machine, Marcus wasn't a man with twenty years of experience and $20,000 in rubber bands. He was just an obstacle. A variable with a velocity and a mass. An inefficiency to be calculated around.

The Kill Zone

The platoon cut in front of him. They didn't signal. They didn't need to. They simply calculated the gap and filled it, leaving Marcus staring at the smooth, silver ass of the rear trailer.

He felt boxed in. The air coming off them was turbulent, buffeting his old Peterbilt.

Marcus rubbed his eyes, the fatigue of the "Witching Hour" settling into his bones. Staying awake for these long hauls was a battle against biology. He relied on black coffee, sunflower seeds, and the adrenaline of the road, but looking at the Ghost Fleet ahead, he realized they didn't have that problem.

They didn't sleep. They didn't get tired. They didn't need to pull over for a piss or a shower. They just ran. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

He thought about the future. How long until the dispatchers replaced him with one of these? He’d heard the rumors—they cost three times as much as a standard rig upfront, but they ran for pennies on the dollar. No salary. No benefits. No human error.

"How fast is this happening?" he whispered to the empty cab. It felt like just yesterday people were laughing at the idea of self-driving cars crashing into walls. Now, they were owning the passing lane.

He reached into the glovebox, his fingers brushing against the rubber-banded stack of cash. It felt small. It felt light.

He looked out at the empty road, the red taillights of the Ghost Fleet fading like dying embers.

"Dinosaurs," he whispered.

He put the Peterbilt in gear. The engine roared, a loud, defiant, fossil-fueled scream that sounded less like a roar and more like a death rattle.

He drove on, but the road felt different now. It wasn't his anymore. He was just a guest on a network, a glitch in the code, waiting to be debugged.
